# Hi there, I'm Willem ðŸ‘‹ 


**I'm an engineer with four years of system engineering experience. Most of my career has been spent working on large-scale systems curated for the U.S. government. My roles have focussed primarily on system-level software testing as well as Model-Based Systems Engineering.**

I created this GitHub to use LaTeX to create documents. I also want to expose myself to more software and software development principles. I hope to utilize this tool more throughout the coming years. 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on improving my scripting and coding skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to start getting more involved in projects like this, as well as use it as a tool for career growth.
- ðŸ¥… 2023/2024 Goals: Become proficient at VS Code and start to learn a programming language.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love motorsports, especially Formula 1.
