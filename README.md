# Hi there, I'm Willem 👋 


### I'm an engineer with over three years of experience (a lot I know). Most of my career has been spent working on large scale systems currated for the U.S governement. My roles have focussed primarily on system level software testing as well as Model Based Systems Engineering. 

I started off writing, updating, and executing manual procedures. In doing so I rapidly gained knowledge of the system.__
From there I moved on to working with CameoEA, taking on the role of MBSE Administrator. We revamped and delivered the model to the customer where it was approved. Following that stint, I was needed back at the test team and continued testing, this time with a focus on Scrum master. __
Since then I've been focussing on creating a more agile work environment for our test team, something I believe is slowly but surely happening.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on improving my scripting and coding skills. Gotta start somewhere!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things. Primarily related to my current Scrum Master role.
- 👯 I’m looking to start getting more involved in projects like this, as well as use it as a tool for recruiters and career growth.
- 🥅 2023/2024 Goals: Become proficient at VS Code and start to learn a programming language!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love motorsports, especially Formula 1.
